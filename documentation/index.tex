\section{Synopsis}
C++ 17 library providing extendable error objects and exceptions.
The library is made available publicly on
\href{\GetLibraryRepository}{Github}
under the
\href{\GetLibraryRepository/blob/master/LICENSE}{MIT License}.

\section{Limitations and Restrictions}
The library officially only supports Visual Studio 2017 and Windows 10.

\section{Usage example}
The folder \href{\GetLibraryRepository/blob/master/example}{example} contains example programs.

\section{Building under Visual Studio 2017}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the solution \texttt{errors.sln} in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.
\item Batch build everything.
\item The folder \texttt{packages} contains the distribution of the library i.e. include files and the
      static libraries for
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item the platforms \texttt{Win32} and \texttt{x64} and
    \item configurations \texttt{Release} and \texttt{Debug}.
  \end{enumerate}
\item Copy the contents of the `packages` folder into a directory. Let
      \verb+[library home]+ be a placeholder denoting the path by which that folder
      can be referenced from your project.
\item Add
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item the include path
\begin{verbatim}
[library home]/primordialmachine/errors/
$(PlatformTarget.toLower())/$(Configuration.toLower())/includes
\end{verbatim}
	and
    \item the library path
\begin{verbatim}
[library home]/primordialmachine/errors/
$(PlatformTarget.toLower())/$(Configuration.toLower())/libraries
\end{verbatim}
    to your project.
\end{enumerate}
\item Link your project with the library \verb+errors.lib+.
\item Add the include directive \lstinline{#include "primordialmachine/errors/include.hpp"} where appropriate.
\item You can now use the functionality provided by the library.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Library Interface Documentation}

\subsection{\texttt{primordialmachine}}
The namespace this library is adding its declarations/definitions to.
The added namespace elements are documented below

\subsection{\texttt{PRIMORDIALMACHINE\_ERROR\_LOCATION}}
A macro evaluating to an \texttt{error\_location} object with the file name and line number of the
location within the C++ program at which the macro was evaluated.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\texttt{error\_position}}
Objects of type \texttt{error\_position} represent locations in a C++ program in terms of the   name
of a source file and the line number of a line in that source file. \texttt{error\_position}      is
nothrow (copy|move) (constructible|assignable).

\subsubsection{\texttt{constexpr error\_position(const char *file, int line)}}
Construct this \texttt{error\_position} object.
\begin{enumerate}
   \item\texttt{file} is a pointer to a static constant string denoting the name of the C++ source file.
   \item\texttt{line} is a non-negative \texttt{int} value denoting the line in the C++ source file.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{\texttt{constexpr const char *file() const}}
A pointer to a static constant string denoting the name of the C++ source file.

\subsubsection{\texttt{constexpr int line() const}}
A positive \texttt{int} value denoting the line in the C++ source file.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\texttt{error}}
The base class from which to derive custom error types.

\subsubsection{\texttt{using message\_type} (v1.0)}
An alias for \texttt{std::string}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{using position\_type} (v1.0)}
An alias for \texttt{primordialmachine::error\_position}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{error(message\_type message, position\_type position)}}
Construct this error object.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item\texttt{message}: The message of the error.
	\item\texttt{position}: The position associated with the error.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{\texttt{constexpr message\_type\& message() const}}
Get the message of the error.

\subsubsection{\texttt{constexpr position\_type\& position() const}}
Get the position of the error.

\subsubsection{\texttt{void raise() const}}
Raise an \texttt{exception} object wrapping a clone of this \texttt{error} object.

\subsubsection{\texttt{virtual void raise\_implementation() const} (v1.3)}
May be overriden by any descendant class \texttt{D} of \texttt{error} to raise an
\texttt{exception} or derived type object.
Exceptions raised by this function are propagated.

\subsubsection{\texttt{virtual error *clone\_implementation() const}}
Must be overriden by any descendant class \texttt{error} to return a clone of the type of that descendant class.
Exceptions raised by this function are propagated.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{\texttt{class exception}}
Class derived from \texttt{std::exception} wrapping around an \texttt{error} or derived type
object. \texttt{exception} or derived types must be nothrow (copy/move) (assignable/constructible).

\subsubsection{\texttt{using error\_type} (v1.0)}
An alias for \lstinline{primordialmachine::error}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{error\_exception(const error\_type\& error)}}
Construct this \texttt{error\_exception} object wrapping a clone of the \texttt{error\_type} or
derived type object \texttt{error}.

\subsubsection{\texttt{constexpr const std\_shared\_ptr\textless{}error\_type\textgreater{}\& error() const}}
Get the wrapped \texttt{error} or derived type object.

\subsubsection{\texttt{const char *what() const override}}
Override of function in \texttt{std::exception}.
Returns a pointer to the message of the wrapped \texttt{error} or derived type object.
